C# Project: Shop Application

This is a project that showcases my ability to create an application with multiple files, classes, and data encapsulation. 
It is also a android application and it also has web application capabilities but it was only setup for local. The application is supposed to mimic online stores like Amazon and Ebay. Here is the source code but if you
want to see it in action go to watch it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0dgAYo5Lg0&ab_channel=RoderickQuiel.
Here I go through every file and then compile the program.
