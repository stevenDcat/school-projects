Python Encryption programs:

The idea of these two is to learn and apply encrytion algorithms for encrypting messages. 
Here we apply AES encryption algorithm (aes.py) and Elliptic Curve cryptography (ecc.py).
They can be simply run in any terminal that has python ( python aes.py and python ecc.py).
